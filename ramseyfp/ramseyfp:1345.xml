    <title>Letter, David Wills in Atlanta, Ga., to J.G.M. Ramsey in Knoxville, Tenn. 1873 Mar. 1</title>
  </titleInfo>
  <abstract>In a letter dated March 1, 1873, Dr. David Wills of Atlanta wrote to J.G.M. Ramsey in Knoxville, TN. Wills regretted that he did not see Ramsey in Greeneville at a ceremony in which a monument was erected in memory of Dr. Doak. Wills mentioned his speech and audience reaction. In his speech, he had spoken highly of Ramsey, of his gratitude to Ramsey for supplying him with facts for his speech, and also of educators, religion in Tennessee, and the first president of Washington, Greeneville, and Tusculum Colleges. Wills promised to send to Ramsey copies of his speech which would be published. He asked Ramsey to correct any errors in it. He also promised to recommend Ramsey for an LLD.</abstract>
