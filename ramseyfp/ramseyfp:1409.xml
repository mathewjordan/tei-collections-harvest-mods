    <title>Letter, Lyman C. Draper in Madison, Wis., to J.G.M. Ramsey in Charlotte, N.C. 1871 Apr. 22</title>
  </titleInfo>
  <abstract>Lyman C. Draper wrote this letter to J.G.M. Ramsey on April 22, 1871. He told him about his upcoming travel plans in Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Florida, North and South Carolina, Virginia, and Washington. He told Ramsey of his plans to visit Col. Thomas Taylor&apos;s son in Louisiana. Draper also mentioned plans to stop by the Georgia Historical Society to examine Gen. James Jackson&apos;s papers and to visit Col. Sam Hammond&apos;s son in Charleston. Taylor, Jackson, and Hammond had served with Thomas Sumter during the American Revolution. He planned to examine a South Carolina Gazette file, while in Charles, and to visit some Sumter relatives while in South Carolina. He still had no plans to visit Knoxville. He had not decided to move to the South due to finances. He felt he would be better off timewise and financially in Wisconsin so as to continue his historical work. He had considered possibly moving to St. Augustine.</abstract>
