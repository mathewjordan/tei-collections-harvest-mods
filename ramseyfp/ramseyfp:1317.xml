    <title>Letter, Mamie Ramsey McIver in Nashville, Tenn., to J.G.M. Ramsey in Knoxville, Tenn. 1874 July 20</title>
  </titleInfo>
  <abstract>Mamie Ramsey McIver wrote to her uncle, J.G.M. Ramsey, on July 20, 1874. She had seen in the newspaper that her uncle had been injured in an accident. She wished him well. She had originally intended to go to him to care for him, but was unable to because she needed to care for her three children and her husband&apos;s aged aunt. Mamie made reference to historical material to be sent to J.G.M. by the aunt. Mamie also sentimentally mentioned her deceased father, William Baine Alexander Ramsey, and her own and her family&apos;s bereavement at his death. She sent J.G.M. news of family and regards from Mrs. Polk. She sent him a picture of her son and love from her family.</abstract>
