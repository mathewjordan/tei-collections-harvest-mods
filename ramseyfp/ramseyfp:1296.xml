      <title>Letter, Lyman C. Draper in Madison, Wis., to J.G.M. Ramsey in Knoxville, Tenn. 1875 Aug. 3</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Lyman C. Draper, Corresponding Secretary, State Historical Society of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis., wrote to J.G.M. Ramsey, Knoxville, Tenn on August 3, 1875. He requested that Dr. Ramsey find out and forward specific information to him on early Southern Presbyterians in regards to how they treated Saturdays. He referred to the book he is writing and to ex-President Johnson&apos;s death. He thought highly of Johnson. J.G.M. Ramsey attached a letter to the end of Draper&apos;s letter. He sent it to Rev. Dr. Park. Ramsey asked Park to help him answer Draper&apos;s letter. Ramsey was not aware of Presbyterians ever using Saturdays in preparation of the Sabbath. He mentioned he knew that four days were devoted to the communion service and Friday as a fast in olden times. He thought there was preparation for the communion service. He asked if this was a practice of the whole church or just in North Carolina and Tennessee.</abstract>
