    <title>Letter, Arthur C. Crozier in Knoxville, Tenn., to J.G.M. Ramsey in Salisbury, N.C. 1871 Jan. 12</title>
  </titleInfo>
  <abstract>Arthur C. Crozier wrote this letter to his brother-in-law, J.G.M. Ramsey, on January 12, 1871. He mentioned one of Dr. Ramseyâ€™s law cases. He had no news about the Brakebill matter, but hoped that payment would be realized from it without a lawsuit. He told Ramsey of his future plans to move to a farm near Knoxville where he hoped to find some business, even though he was doubtful due to some conflicts in regards to a misunderstanding he&apos;d had with someone.</abstract>
