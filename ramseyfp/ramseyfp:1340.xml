      <title>Letter, W.A. Harrison in Harrodsburg, Ky., to J.G.M. Ramsey in Knoxville, Tenn. 1873 Nov. 25</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Rev. W.A. Harrison wrote to J. G. M. Ramsey on Nov. 25, 1873. He wrote about their times in church together. He told Ramsey that he and his wife were preserving J.G.M.â€™s letters for their daughter and so that Harrison could cite him as an example for the young men of his church. He felt that the youth of the present were dissipating their talents and health. He felt the youth should look to the generations before them as examples. He said he could not help much with the church in Knoxville Ramsey had mentioned. He had sentimental remembrance of Mrs. Ramsey as a fine homemaker and hostess. He felt women like her were no longer around. He remembered her as being a wonderful woman and that Ramsey was truly blessed. He had many precious memories about the Ramsey family. He told Ramsey he would have a lot stored up in heaven due to all he&apos;d accomplished on earth. He sent his love to friends in Knoxville. He knew he would see them all some day, if not in life then in heaven.</abstract>
