      <title>Letter, Lyman C. Draper in Madison, Wis., to J.G.M. Ramsey in Charlotte, N.C. 1871 Apr. 2</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Lyman C. Draper wrote to J.G.M. Ramsey on April 2, 1871 hoping the letter would get to him even though he wasn&apos;t sure Ramsey was in Charlotte. He mentioned that he had sent an excellent speech by a Judge Walker in pamphlet form to Ramsey. He told Ramsey he might not go through Knoxville on an upcoming trip. He said it would be out of his way, and he didn&apos;t know if the Sumpter descendants would know enough family history for it to be worth his while. He asked Ramsey to let him know if he was still in Charlotte. He also mentioned historical correspondence he was having with a Dr. Logan from Alabama.</abstract>
