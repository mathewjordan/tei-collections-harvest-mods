      <title>Letter, W.A. Harrison in Harrodsburg, Ky., to J.G.M. Ramsey in Knoxville, Tenn. 1874 Nov. 12</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Rev. W.A. Harrison wrote to J.G.M. Ramsey on Nov. 12, 1874. He told J.G.M. he was sorry about his injury resulting from a fall from his horse. He discussed politics, expressing happiness in the outcome of recent elections which he saw as a Southern victory. He saw Ramsey as a prophet, as well as a historian. He agreed with Ramsey that the South would rise again and save our country. He saw this as one of God&apos;s works. He bemoaned the atrocities that had happened to the South. He thought the North would come around to the South&apos;s way of thinking. He thought the South would attain Constitutional freedom through the recent elections. He realized toward the end of his letter which was meant to be a &quot;get well expression,&quot; that it had turned into a political ranting and apologized to Ramsey. He knew Ramsey would understand because of his mutual views.</abstract>
