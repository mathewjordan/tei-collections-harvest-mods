      <title>Letter, W.A. Harrison in Harrodsburg, Ky., to J.G.M. Ramsey in Knoxville, Tenn. 1873 Feb. 21</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Rev. W. A. Harrison wrote to J. G. M. Ramsey on Feb. 21, 1873. He mentions Ramsey&apos;s love for Tennessee and the history he had made known to many. He was glad the war had not taken Ramsey&apos;s life and that Ramsey had returned to East Tennessee. Harrison was pleased to be remembered by so many people and happy about the growth of his former church. He tells Ramsey he would love to come visit. He sends his love to several people. He was currently preaching in his hometown of Harrodsburg, Kentucky. This is the place he was baptized and where he was while writing the letter.</abstract>
